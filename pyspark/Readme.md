### Spark
- Spark is one of latest frameworks to quickly and easily handle big data
- first released February 2013, created at Berkley
- written in Scala, so Scala normally gets the latest features
- Scala is written in Java, so Java API normally does well too!
- Python and R APIs are slowest to catch up
- flexible alternative to MapReduce - i.e. it handles splitting of computational tasks across nodes
